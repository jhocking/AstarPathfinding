# AstarPathfinding
WebGL build at https://jhocking.itch.io/state-machine-ai

Here's a library for and demo of A* on a 2D grid. Many years ago I had programmed a pathfinding library in AS3 to use in Flash, and I decided to port it to C# for use in Unity.

For many games, you would be better off using the NavMesh pathfinding built into Unity, or you could use the A* Pathfinding Project. However those approaches aren't great choices pathfinding on a simple 2D grid, plus this library is a good reference for you to learn how A* works. Click and drag the green and red squares in the interactive demo to see the pathfinding algorithm in action.

I relied heavily on this tutorial when I programmed the original ActionScript 3 library:<br>
